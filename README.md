### about-me ###
my name is **Jonatas** but my nickname is jhony, that's what almost everyone calls me ☺️  
I was born in 1990...
loving husband and doting father of 2 boys.

I have a technical course in Industrial Mechanics, an area that I think is very cool...  
I'm currently majoring in **Analysis and Systems Development** at **[ELO College]()**,   
I'm a programming lover, and I have a special interest in the field of artificial intelligence and I intend to make it my job.
